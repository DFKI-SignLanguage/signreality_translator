# Text to gloss machine translation

This is a server that allows translations from text to sign language glosses. The server loads a pre-trained translation model compatible to the sequence-to-sequence Huggingface interface and exposes a translate function as an XMLRPC server. 

## Requirements

A machine with a GPU and 32 GB of RAM. 


## Installation

1. Clone this code on your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/DFKI-SignLanguage/text-to-gloss-machine-translation.git .
```
2. Go to the sub-directory named "models" and download the translation model
```
cd models
wget https://cloud-affective.dfki.de/s/SJCWfKdwfYDTTQL/download/result_fold_0_best_model.pt 
cd ..
```
3. Create a virtual machine and install the requirements
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Start the translation server
```
venv/bin/python translator.py
```



## Usage

The XML-RPC server can be accessed by any compatible client. An example on how to use from a commandline can be found here:

```
curl -s \
-H "Content-Type: text/xml" \
-d '<?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
<methodName>translate</methodName>
<params>
<param>
<value><string>der zug ICE 234 aus mainz f√§hrt um 4 : 40 Uhr .</string></value>
</param>
</params>
</methodCall>' \
http://localhost:8000/RPC2
```

Please not that the text needs to be lowercased. 

Alternatively, you can try directly from within Python code with the provided example:

    python translator_client.py


## Configuration

The translator script takes the parameter `--config` and allows parameters to be specified in a YAML configuration file. Two sample configuration files are provided. Example:

```
venv/bin/python translator.py --config config/translator.yaml
```

The following parameters can be configured:
 - __pretrained model__: the name of the huggingface pre-trained model that needs to be loaded. By default it is `facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M`. It doesn't need to be downloaded.
 - __finetuned_model__: the fine-tuned model that needs to be downloaded as instructed above. By default it resides in the subdirectory `model`
 - __port__: the port where the server shall run
 - __rpc_path__: the rpc path that the server will respond to
 - __exposed_function__: the name of the function that will be exposed to XML_RPC

There is also the commandline option `--listen-all-interfaces`.  If true, theserver will listen on all network interfaces, otherwise only on localhost.
